# Dapps Purposes

Decentralized Applications are part of a new wave of web applications
meant to increase transparency around commercial transactions,
governamental process, supply chains, and all those systems that
currently require manual trust between customer and supplier, user
and provider.

Some claim Dapps could be the backbone of Web 3.0.

# What a decentralized application is

Before introducing the concept of "decentralized" maybe it's better
to talk a bit about the meaning of "centralized"

A centralized application or system is controlled by a single or
central entity: an individual, company, institution, governamental
agency, and so on.

The user trusts the good faith of the central entity (he/it has the
full controll of your data and the system itself)

In a centrilized world users have to trust services provider, and
unknow or less know e-commerce has many many few users because of
trustness.

In order to solve trustfulness problems decentralized applications
do a great work.

[*] Favorable transaction conditions -
 -  This would remove one of the biggest reservation you may had
    about an unknow e-commerce, the transaction would be completed
    and the money would be fully transferred to the retailer
    only when the retailer had complied with all the conditions
    associated with the transaction, such as confirmation of
    safe delivery.

[*] Independent transaction execution and verification -
 -  No transaction processed by third party, but from many
    participants in the platfrom supporting the e-commerce.  The
    mechanism that all parties would use to agree on the verification
    of a transaction is called consensus.

    The consensus mechanism would reassure you that the promised
    transaction conditions would be enforced and verified by many
    independent parties rather than an unknown retailer.

[*] Transparency -
 -  You'd be able to check the code processing the transa tion and
    verify that it was observing the specified conditions before
    transferring your money to retailer.

How that could works?

Each node on the network would
- Be able to process a transaction the same way other nodes do
- Verirify all transactions in the same way other nodes do
- Contribute in an equal way to the outcome of a transaction

This architecture would be that the processing would be decentrilized
to a network of independent nodes rather than being centralized to
a specific set of servers that a specific entity owns.

Applications built on this architecture are known as decentralized
applications.
